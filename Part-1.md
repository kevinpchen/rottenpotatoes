# Part 1 - BDD Introduction

The goal of BDD is to express behavioral tasks rather than low-level operations.

The background step of all the scenarios in this homework requires that the movies database contain some movies. 
It would go against the goal of BDD to do this by writing scenarios that spell out every interaction required to add 
a new movie, since adding new movies is not what these scenarios are about.

Recall that the `Given` steps of a user story specify the initial state of the system: it does not matter how the 
system got into that state.

First, verify that your app is set up correctly without errors:

```sh
bundle exec cucumber
```

Read through the output. Does it make sense? (Failing tests are expected because you haven't implemented them yet.)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> For this entire assignment, you need to modify `movie_steps.rb` under 
> `features/step_definitions` as well as `sort_movie_list.feature` and `filter_movie_list.feature`
> under `features/`

For Part 1, you will create a step definition that will match the step `Given the following movies exist` in the 
`Background` section of both `sort_movie_list.feature` and `filter_movie_list.feature`. (Later in the course, we will 
show how to DRY out the repeated `Background` sections in the two feature files.)

Add your code in the `movie_steps.rb` step definition file. You can just use ActiveRecord calls to directly add 
movies to the database; it's OK to bypass the GUI associated with creating new movies, since that's not what these 
scenarios are testing. Tip: you can use the `log` method just like `puts` to output to the console while running 
Cucumber tests.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Remove any instances of `pending` in code when you implement each step definition.

SUCCESS is when all **Background** steps for the scenarios in `filter_movie_list.feature` and 
`sort_movie_list.feature` are passing Green.
